# Tog-New-World
A script I wrote for the game *'Tower of God: New World'* to automate some boring functions.

## What can it do?
Can automatically scale the tower in adventure, complete the trial of chaos.

## How to use
- Download [Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) to connect and allow your phone to be controlled by your computer. Any other program that have that functionality (or similar) will work too, like Bluestack.
  - Good and fast tutorial for installing and using Scrcpy: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y35SPOaNWk&t=193s)
- Start the main file using `py main.py`
- You will be asked to enter the name of the window broadcasting your phone, not the name of the program, the window's.

## Info
If you your phone is laggy or some other problems appear like being out of sync or getting stuck in another section, it will be able to fix itself, don't touch it.
Otherwise you can simply start it again.
